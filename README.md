# State Website Frontend Challenge:

## Worklog: 
### Thursday 06/23/2022:
Project Assigned, worked for about 1 hour 20min, created the react app, configured tailwind, added the fonts and their font-weights, just two Open Sans and Roboto Sans. The font weights shown on the PDF look a little "off" like Open Sans Bold looks like Open Sans SemiBold on Google fonts, so will have to see the Fonts Displayed to see, right now just added <br />
Open Sans:<br /> 
Light:300, Medium:400, and SemiBold:600<br />
Roboto Sans:<br />
Regular:400
Medium: 500<br />

 Added the Color Palette, for time sake, added in each color depending on the row number, for example in tailwind text-row3-5 would be the third row and 5th color to the right so based on the pdf file this would be the red color #E9261D
